# Facebook Friend List App

This is a Maven-based Java project for an app that retrieves a person's Facebook friends' names using a profile link.

## Description

In this project, we've created a Java class, `FacebookFriendList`, and a corresponding JUnit test class, `FacebookFriendListTest`, to test the functionality of the `getFriends` method.
